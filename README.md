# Getting started
The easiest way to get started is to install [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). After that you will need a C++ compiler for your platform:
| Platform | Compiler | Instructions |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Windows | msvc | [Build tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022) |
| Linux | gcc | [Install via your package manager](https://www.ubuntupit.com/how-to-install-and-use-gcc-compiler-on-linux-system/)
| macOS | Apple Clang | Install xcode from the app store |

After that you should be able to clone the repo and open it up in vscode
